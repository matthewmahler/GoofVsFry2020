# gatsby-simple-contentful-starter

This Gatsby starter is able to connect to your Contentful account. [View the live demo](https://gatsby-simple-contentful-starter.netlify.com/)!

## Quick Start

First, create a new Gatsby site from the starter:

```bash
$ gatsby new my-fun-site https://github.com/cwlsn/gatsby-simple-contentful-starter
```

Rename `sample.env` to `.env` and fill in your Contentful details.

This starter will try to talk to a Contentful Model named `homePage`.

From your project's root, make sure dependencies are installed and start the Gatsby development server.

```bash
$ npm i
$ gatsby develop
```

## Production on Netlify

Push your site to Git and create a new site from that repo on Netlify. Make sure to add your Contentful creds in the environment variables.
